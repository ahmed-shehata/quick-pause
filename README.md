## Description
Quick Pause your music when audio output device changes. Simulate AirPod's Ear Detection feature.

## Inspiration
Inspired by Apple AirPod's [Ear Detection feature](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207009), quick-pause will automatically pause/resume your music whenever an Audio Device change has been detected, preventing Macbook's loud speaker from taking over and embarrasing you in front of your coworkers (unless you have a nice taste in music).

[AuKey's B60 Headphones](https://www.amazon.co.uk/AUKEY-Bluetooth-Headphones-Resistance-Microphone-Black/dp/B07N19TD5V) have QuickSwitch feature which automatically turns off the bluetooth earphones whenever magnetically attached. Combining this with quick-pause will give you seamless control over your music.

## Usage
- Build and run quick-pause in cli. 
- Currently only supports Spotify (Mac)
